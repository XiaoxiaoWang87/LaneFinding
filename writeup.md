# Finding Lane Lines on the Road 

### Goals

1. Create an image processing pipeline that finds lane lines on the road. 
2. Apply the lane finding pipeline to identify lane lines in video. 
3. Be familiar with simple image processing and edge detection techniques and their shortcomings in practice.

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
